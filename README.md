One of the issues when selecting a new telecom bundle for your house is the amount of possibilities to combine plans and bundles to get what you need. The diagram below is a simplified version of a bundling scheme that a service provider might offer for Broadband, TV and Landline.

In the diagram, bundles can be mounted starting from any of the nodes and following the possible connections between nodes. The value on the connections represent additional price (positive numbers) or discounts (negative numbers) to get a bundle. Bundles can have several addons, but cannot have more than one broadband (type: "bb"), tv (type: "tv") or landline (type: "ll"). Each node has a "type", "price" and a name. If price is not present, price is equal to zero.
